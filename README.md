## Taproot is a proposed Bitcoin protocol upgrade that can be deployed as a forward-compatible soft fork. By combining the Schnorr signature scheme with MAST ([Merklized Alternative Script Tree](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/99539/what-are-merklized-alternative-script-trees)) and a new scripting language called Tapscript, Taproot will expand Bitcoinâ€™s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy by letting users mask complex smart contracts as a regular bitcoin transaction.

------

A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is forward-compatible. See more here: [Soft fork bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork) 

Soft forks can be activated in several ways. Multiple of the previous soft forks were activated using [BIP9](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0009), which required a supermajority of hash power to signal support for the upgrade. [BIP8](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0008) is the successor of BIP9. BIP8 gives the option to activate the upgrade at the end of the signaling period even without a supermajority of miners signaling support. In the listed activation proposals below, the 'true' or 'false' indicates whether a signal period would end in activation. BIP9 worked equivalently to BIP8 without activation at the end.

## Proposal overview

More in-depth information on [Taproot activation proposals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals) can be found in the Bitcoin Wiki.

**The aim of this site is to assist in the activation of the Taproot soft fork. We have reached out to several Bitcoin mining pools to find out if:**

1. If they support the Taproot upgrade
1. If so, which activation method they prefer
1. If they want to insert a coinbase message in a block to announce their preference (even before the actual activation window opens)

Note: TBD = To be decided
